# **Computational Reproduction and Analysis of Collapse Loads in Laminated Composite Stringer-Stiffened Curved Panels**

## **Introduction to Aerospace Structural Stability and Postbuckling Mechanics**

The continuous evolution of aerospace engineering is fundamentally driven by the imperative to maximize structural efficiency while simultaneously minimizing weight. This dual objective has led to the widespread adoption of thin-walled, lightweight structures, particularly in the design of aircraft fuselages and wing skins. A defining characteristic of these structures is their susceptibility to buckling under compressive loads. Historically, the onset of buckling was considered synonymous with structural failure, dictating highly conservative design paradigms. However, extensive experimental and theoretical research, beginning in the early twentieth century, revealed that appropriately designed stiffened panels possess a remarkable capacity to withstand axial compression loads that significantly exceed their initial buckling threshold.1 This phenomenon, known as the postbuckling reserve, is a critical parameter in the optimization of aerospace vehicles. By permitting the skin between adjacent stringers to buckle locally while the stiffeners maintain global structural integrity, engineers can safely extract maximum performance from minimum material.1

The transition from isotropic metallic alloys to advanced laminated composite materials has introduced extraordinary opportunities for structural tailoring, alongside unprecedented analytical complexities. Carbon fiber-reinforced polymers exhibit high specific stiffness and strength, coupled with inherent anisotropy and complex failure mechanisms such as interlaminar delamination, matrix cracking, and fiber fracture.3 The postbuckling behavior of composite stringer-stiffened panels is characterized by severe geometric non-linearities and intricate stress redistributions.1 While high-fidelity non-linear finite element methods can accurately simulate these phenomena, they are computationally exorbitant and labor-intensive, rendering them impractical for the thousands of rapid iterations required during preliminary design and optimization phases.5 To address this computational bottleneck, engineering approximations such as the effective width method have been adapted.

Originally conceived by von Kármán, Sechler, and Donnell in the 1930s for flat, isotropic plates, the effective width concept postulates that the load-carrying capacity of a buckled panel is concentrated in a hypothetical strip of skin adjacent to the stiffeners.1 The extension of this classical theory to handle curved, laminated composite structures represents a monumental leap in applied mechanics, formalized by Pevzner, Abramovich, and Weller through the development of the TEW (Technion Effective Width) code.1 This report provides an exhaustive, multi-layered analysis of the extended effective width method, detailing its theoretical foundation, physical interpretations, and computational implementation. Central to this report is the programmatic reproduction of the analytical methodology and experimental results using a customized Python architecture, fulfilling the specific requirement to map the foundational data into a highly accessible, dictionary-like structure. By dissecting the correlations and discrepancies between empirical tests, finite element models, and analytical predictions across a spectrum of structural configurations, this analysis synthesizes the nuanced physical behaviors governing the ultimate collapse of composite aerospace structures.

## **Historical and Theoretical Foundations of the Effective Width Paradigm**

The conceptual foundation of the effective width method was laid during the rapid expansion of aeronautical engineering in the 1930s and 1940s. Investigators such as Cox, Marguerre, and Lahde recognized that predicting the ultimate load capacity of flat stiffened panels required a departure from linear eigenvalue buckling solutions.1 The fundamental premise asserts that once the flat plate elements between stringers buckle, their out-of-plane deformation causes a highly non-uniform stress distribution. The central regions of the buckled skin shed their axial load, while the regions immediately adjacent to the rigid stringers continue to absorb compressive stresses up to the material's yield point.

The genius of the effective width approach lies in its simplification: replacing the complex, non-uniform stress field with an equivalent, uniform stress acting over a reduced width of the plate. Marguerre formalized this relationship, proposing that the effective width of the participating skin, denoted as ![][image1], is proportional to the stringer spacing, ![][image2], and governed by the ratio of the critical buckling stress of the skin to the average stress experienced by the stringers.1 This classical formulation provided a reliable average approximation for metal panels but relied heavily on the assumption of material isotropy and flat geometries.

Translating this methodology to modern aerospace architectures demands profound modifications. First, modern fuselage structures are inherently curved, introducing shell mechanics where membrane forces and bending moments are intimately coupled.1 Second, laminated composites exhibit macroscopic orthotropy or general anisotropy, defined by the extensional stiffness matrix, the bending stiffness matrix, and the extension-bending coupling matrix.7 The behavior of the composite skin cannot be described by a single Young's modulus; rather, it requires the integration of plies with varying orientations, thicknesses, and material properties. The extended effective width method, as implemented in the TEW code, addresses these complexities by reformulating the equivalent column model to account for the unique bending, torsional, and coupled instability modes exhibited by asymmetric composite stringers attached to curved cylindrical skins.1

## **Mathematical and Physical Formulations of the TEW Approach**

The analytical determination of the collapse load within the TEW framework is a sequential process that evaluates both the initial local instability of the skin and the ultimate global instability of the integrated skin-stringer assembly.1 The method systematically replaces the complex three-dimensional shell structure with an idealized one-dimensional equivalent column model, demanding precise derivations of equivalent stiffness parameters.

### **Formulations for the First Buckling of the Stiffened Panel**

The first buckling event in a widely spaced stringer-stiffened panel is almost universally localized to the skin between adjacent stringers. Accurately predicting this critical load is the prerequisite for all subsequent postbuckling calculations.1 The TEW approach employs two distinct methodologies to compute this threshold: a semi-empirical formulation and an approximate analytical solution.

The semi-empirical approach adapts formulas originally derived for thin-walled isotropic cylinders by Kanemitsu and Nojima.1 To apply these equations to composite materials, the formulation defines an equivalent structural thickness and an equivalent Young's modulus. The equivalent Young's modulus is derived from the average bending stiffness of the composite laminate, incorporating the major Poisson's ratio, yielding a homogenized parameter that mimics an isotropic material's resistance to flexure.1 Utilizing these equivalent parameters, the compressive buckling stress ratio for the composite cylinder is calculated. This is subsequently combined with the buckling stress ratio of a simply-supported flat composite plate using an interaction equation formulated by Redshaw.1 This synthesis effectively captures the stabilizing influence of the panel's curvature while accounting for the finite boundary conditions imposed by the stiffeners.

Conversely, the approximate analytical solution approaches the problem through the lens of classic shell theory, specifically employing Donnell's simplified equilibrium and compatibility equations for composite cylindrical panels.1 The analytical model assumes that the curved panel skin is simply-supported in the longitudinal direction along the centerlines of the stringer webs, and clamped in the circumferential direction along the loaded edges. The partial differential equations governing the out-of-plane displacement and the Airy stress function are solved by assuming a separable solution involving sinusoidal mode shapes in the longitudinal direction.1 By substituting the assumed mode shapes into the equilibrium equations, the methodology derives a characteristic equation—a fourth-order polynomial whose roots dictate the stability of the shell.1 The critical buckling force is determined by iterating through integer wave numbers to find the minimum axial load that satisfies the clamped boundary conditions.

### **The Iterative Convergence of the Effective Width**

Once the applied load exceeds the first local buckling threshold, the structural mechanics transition into the postbuckling regime. The methodology hypothesizes an equivalent column cross-section composed of the physical stringer geometry and a variable strip of effective skin.1 The determination of this effective width is governed by a modified Marguerre relation, which dictates that the effective width is a function of the cubic root of the ratio between the critical skin buckling stress and the instantaneous column stress.1

Because the column stress is intrinsically dependent on the total area of the equivalent cross-section, and the area is dependent on the effective width, the solution necessitates an iterative numerical algorithm.1 The algorithm initializes with an assumption of zero effective width, representing a state where the skin has completely ceased to participate in load carrying. The flexural and torsional rigidities of the isolated stringer are computed, and the global column buckling load is determined. This initial column stress is then fed back into the Marguerre relation to calculate a new, non-zero effective width. The cross-sectional properties are subsequently updated to include this strip of skin, and the column buckling load is recalculated. This cyclic feedback loop continues until the calculated effective width converges to a stable value, a process that physically represents the equilibrium state of stress redistribution between the buckled skin and the stiffener.1

### **Torsional, Flexural, and Warping Rigidities**

The accuracy of the global column buckling load depends entirely on the rigorous derivation of the equivalent cross-section's rigidities. Under the Euler-Bernoulli beam assumptions, the flexural rigidity of the composite assembly is calculated by integrating the stiffness contributions of every individual composite layer relative to the true neutral axis.1 The position of the neutral axis is derived by enforcing longitudinal force equilibrium under a pure bending moment, factoring in the membrane rigidity and the coupling rigidity of the web, flanges, and the effective skin.1

For aerospace panels stiffened by open-section stringers such as blade or J-form profiles, global collapse is frequently precipitated by torsional or combined bending-torsion modes rather than pure flexural Euler buckling.1 When an asymmetric stringer twists, it does not rotate about its geometric centroid, but rather about its shear center. The TEW formulation meticulously calculates the location of the shear center by evaluating the internal shear force distributions resulting from a transverse load.1

Furthermore, the twisting of the stringer induces longitudinal warping of the cross-section. Because the stringer is physically bonded to the skin, this warping is partially restrained, generating secondary longitudinal stresses that substantially increase the effective torsional rigidity of the column.1 The mathematical formulation introduces a warping rigidity parameter, representing the resistance of the flanges to lateral bending during twist. The total torsional resistance is thus formulated as a combination of the pure St. Venant torsional rigidity—derived from the in-plane shear modulus of the composite plies—and the warping rigidity.1 Equating the internal resisting moments to the external destabilizing moments yields a set of coupled differential equations of motion, the solution of which provides the critical thresholds for pure torsion and combined flexural-torsional collapse.

## **Structural Configuration and Material Properties of the Study**

The validation of the analytical framework relies on a comprehensive matrix of physical experiments and finite element simulations conducted on highly tailored, carbon fiber-reinforced polymer panels.1 The macroscopic geometric architecture is consistent across all test specimens, designed to reflect the curvature and stiffening ratios typical of commercial aircraft fuselages.1 The total length of the panels is established at seven hundred and twenty millimeters, with an effective unsupported length of six hundred and sixty millimeters between the potting boundaries. The panels exhibit a constant radius of curvature of nine hundred and thirty-eight millimeters, spanning an arc length of six hundred and eighty millimeters.1

The composite material properties utilized for both the empirical manufacturing and the analytical derivations are characterized by profound orthotropy.1 The longitudinal Young's modulus of the unidirectional plies is reported at one hundred and forty-seven thousand, three hundred megapascals, providing immense extensional stiffness along the fiber direction. The transverse Young's modulus is significantly lower, measured at eleven thousand, eight hundred megapascals, reflecting the compliance of the polymer matrix. The in-plane shear modulus is six thousand megapascals, and the major Poisson's ratio is zero point three.1 These properties serve as the fundamental inputs for the constitutive stiffness matrices governing the shell and column mechanics.

The test matrix is divided into specific configurations, documented extensively to isolate the variables of stiffener geometry, stiffener density, and cross-sectional asymmetry.1

### **Table 2: Material and Geometric Configuration of Blade and J-Form Panels**

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Total Panel Length** | 720 mm | 720 mm |
| **Free Panel Length** | 660 mm | 660 mm |
| **Radius of Curvature** | 938 mm | 938 mm |
| **Arc Length** | 680 mm | 680 mm |
| **Stringer Pitch / Distance** | 136 mm (Cases I, II) ; 113 mm (Case III) | 136 mm (Case IV) ; 174 mm (Case V) |
| **Ply Thickness** | 0.125 mm | 0.125 mm |
| **Skin Laminate Layup** | **![][image3]** | **![][image3]** or ![][image4] |
| **Stringer Laminate Layup** | **![][image5]** | **![][image5]** |
| **Stringer Web Height** | 20 mm (Cases I, III) ; 15 mm (Case II) | 20.5 mm |
| **Stringer Flange Width** | N/A (Blade profile) | 10 mm (Case IV) ; 20 mm (Case V) |
| **Stringer Feet Width** | 60 mm | 60 mm |

The architectural logic behind the laminate layups reveals a deep integration of structural tailoring. The panel skins primarily employ a quasi-isotropic baseline of zero, plus-minus forty-five, and ninety-degree plies, ensuring a balanced resistance to the multi-axial membrane fields generated during global panel bending and localized buckling.1 In contrast, the stringers demand an aggressive, orthotropic layup of plus-minus forty-five degrees combined with clustered zero-degree plies.1 The heavy concentration of zero-degree fibers maximizes the longitudinal membrane rigidity and the bending stiffness of the stringer, which is essential given that the stringer must carry the overwhelming majority of the axial compressive load once the skin buckles. The inclusion of the plus-minus forty-five-degree plies ensures adequate shear stiffness to combat torsional instability and premature shear crippling of the web.1

The test cases are segregated by their stiffening architecture. Case I utilizes five heavily stiffened T-type blades with a web height of twenty millimeters, representing a structurally robust baseline.1 Case II drastically reduces the flexural rigidity of the assembly by dropping the web height to fifteen millimeters, transitioning the panel into a lightly stiffened regime.1 Case III investigates the effect of lateral nodal constraint by increasing the stringer count to six, thereby tightening the stringer pitch.1 Cases IV and V introduce asymmetry through the use of J-form stringers. The J-form profiles possess an upper flange that offsets the shear center from the web centerline, coupling the bending and torsional deformation modes.1 Case IV employs thin, ten-millimeter flanges, while Case V utilizes thick, twenty-millimeter flanges combined with a wider stringer spacing and a symmetrically doubled skin thickness to maintain overall panel weight efficiency.1

## **Computational Architecture and Python Implementation**

To faithfully reproduce the analytical methodology and the comparative validation matrix from the source study, a robust programmatic architecture is required. The specific directive mandates the creation of a Python script that begins by mapping all empirical, finite element, and analytical results from the study's foundational data into a dictionary-like structure for rapid access and programmatic evaluation.

The Python implementation presented below transcends simple data storage; it establishes an object-oriented paradigm designed to encapsulate the physical properties of the composite stiffened panels and dynamically execute the iterative effective width algorithm. The dictionary structure provides an optimal ![][image6] time complexity for retrieving comparative metrics during the final analytical validation phase.

HERE ADD A LINK TO THE MAIN PYTHON SCRIPT

The computational script executes three interdependent functional domains. The first domain statically maps the disparate data sources into a hierarchical, strongly-typed dictionary structure, explicitly fulfilling the requirement for programmatic mapping. The nested keys intuitively segregate the localized buckling thresholds from the ultimate collapse forces, further dividing the metrics by their methodological origins—experimental testing, non-linear finite element simulation, and analytical formulation.

The second domain implements the object-oriented physics engine, represented by the LaminatedCompositePanel class. This architecture models the step-by-step mathematical sequence required to solve the highly non-linear Marguerre relation. The fundamental coupling between the equivalent column area—which varies continuously with the effective width—and the column buckling stress forms the rigid backbone of the iterative execute\_effective\_width\_convergence algorithm. The algorithm mimics the physical progression of postbuckling, iterating until the redistribution of stresses between the buckled skin and the stiffening stringers reaches mathematical equilibrium. Finally, the validation utility automatically parses the empirical scatter, averages the physical results, and quantifies the exact percentage deviation of both the computationally expensive finite element models and the rapid TEW analytical model, providing immediate insights into algorithmic fidelity.

## **Comprehensive Analysis of Experimental and Computational Results**

The ultimate validation of the extended effective width methodology relies on directly comparing its analytical outputs against highly sophisticated finite element models and the reality of physical compression tests.1 The experimental and calculated values for both the localized first skin buckling force and the total structural collapse force are systematically reconstructed in the table below.

A granular, case-by-case evaluation of the tabulated results reveals profound physical insights into the interaction between the intrinsic rigidity of the stiffeners and the predictive accuracy of the various mathematical formulations.1

The physical experiments conducted for Case I yielded an average structural collapse load of approximately two hundred and eighteen kilonewtons.9 The non-linear finite element model exhibited a slight conservative underprediction, calculating the collapse at two hundred and four kilonewtons. In sharp contrast, the proposed TEW analytical model overpredicted the collapse capacity, finalizing at two hundred and forty point five kilonewtons.1 This approximately ten percent discrepancy highlights a critical mechanical phenomenon inherent to heavily stiffened configurations. Because the twenty-millimeter web height endows the stringer with immense flexural stiffness, the analytical formulation logically assumes a deep postbuckling regime where the skin effectively sheds almost the entirety of its compressive load to the stringers without global column failure.1 However, in physical reality, this extreme load transfer induces massive interlaminar shear stresses directly at the skin-stiffener interface. This localized concentration of stress frequently initiates premature flange disbonding or micro-delaminations within the resin matrix—a highly localized failure mode that the global, homogenized one-dimensional effective width approximation does not intrinsically possess the capability to capture.2

Contrasting directly with the robust architecture of Case I, Case II significantly reduces the stiffener web height to fifteen millimeters, drastically diminishing the flexural resistance of the overall assembly.1 This reduction plunged the experimental average collapse load down to roughly one hundred and fifty-three kilonewtons. Interestingly, both the sophisticated finite element model and the TEW analytical model underpredicted the physical collapse load, calculating one hundred and thirty-five kilonewtons and one hundred and twenty-seven kilonewtons, respectively.9 This simultaneous underprediction is highly indicative of the behavior of lightly stiffened panels. In such configurations, the margin between the initial buckling of the skin and the ultimate global collapse of the panel is exceedingly narrow.1 The stringers themselves begin to experience severe bending or torsional instability almost simultaneously with the deep buckling of the surrounding skin. The underprediction by the TEW method suggests that the analytical algorithms may conservatively penalize the effective width calculation prematurely when the stringer itself approaches its critical state, triggering an algorithmic failure before the physical structure has fully exhausted its latent capacity for secondary load-redistribution.1

Case III represents a highly constrained, densely packed geometric architecture. By decreasing the stringer spacing to one hundred and thirteen millimeters and increasing the stringer count to six, the physical width of the local skin buckles is inherently restricted.1 The proximity of the nodal support lines physically forces the skin into shorter, more stable wavelengths. The TEW code demonstrated exceptional correlation in this highly constrained environment, predicting a collapse load of two hundred and eighty-one point seven kilonewtons compared to the experimental average of two hundred and seventy-one point four kilonewtons.9 The reduced distance between the stringers stabilizes the skin so effectively that the analytical assumption of clamped and simply-supported boundary conditions becomes highly reflective of the true physical boundary constraints, minimizing computational error.1

The introduction of J-form stringers in Cases IV and V fundamentally disrupts the symmetry of the buckling kinematics.1 Unlike symmetric T-type blades, the upper flanges on J-form stringers shift the mechanical shear center away from the geometric centroid of the web.1 This asymmetry dictates that any transverse deformation will inevitably couple with torsional rotation, necessitating the strict incorporation of warping rigidity and combined differential equations of motion within the TEW calculations.1 In Case IV, featuring thin J-form stringers, the TEW model conservatively underpredicted the collapse load by calculating two hundred and two point six kilonewtons against an experimental average of two hundred and twenty-eight point three kilonewtons.9 This perfectly mirrors the conservative trend observed in the lightly stiffened T-type panels of Case II.

Conversely, Case V, featuring incredibly robust J-form stringers with twenty-millimeter upper flanges, saw the TEW model overpredict the collapse load by a significant margin—three hundred and fifty-four point nine kilonewtons versus the physical average of two hundred and ninety-one point four kilonewtons.9 This mirrors the overprediction observed in the heavily stiffened Case I panels. Furthermore, Case V exhibited massive experimental scatter in the exact determination of the first skin buckling load, with tests ranging from fifty-nine point eight kilonewtons to ninety point eight kilonewtons.9 The extreme physical asymmetry of thick J-stringers likely induces significant pre-buckling out-of-plane eccentricities and torsional pre-loads directly onto the thin composite skin. This built-in structural torque drastically amplifies the structure's sensitivity to minute manufacturing imperfections, causing massive deviations in when and where the first visual skin buckle manifests.10 Analytical models typically assume pristine, geometrically perfect boundary conditions; the failure of the semi-empirical formulas to match the physical initiation of buckling in these asymmetric configurations is a direct result of these unmodeled pre-torsional constraints.1

## **Advanced Finite Element Validations and Broad Industry Context**

The development and validation of the modified effective width approach cannot be isolated from the broader context of European aerospace initiatives. Major, multi-national collaborative research projects such as COCOMAT (Safe Design of Composite Airframe Structures by Accurate Simulation of Collapse), DAEDALOS (Dynamics in Aircraft Engineering Design and Analysis for Light Optimized Structures), and DESICOS (New Robust Design Guideline for Imperfection Sensitive Composite Launcher Structures) served as the primary drivers behind the resurgence in studying stringer-stiffened composite shells.5 These aerospace consortiums recognized that extracting the maximum performance from composite fuselages required a fundamental shift from non-buckling design philosophies to fully optimized, deep postbuckling utilization.5

Within these projects, advanced finite element analysis became the gold standard for validation. Finite element codes such as NASTRAN, ANSYS, and ABAQUS utilize highly sophisticated numerical techniques to track the structural response.5 To capture the transition from initial buckling to ultimate collapse, these models employ incremental, geometrically non-linear analysis techniques, frequently incorporating linear membrane constant strain triangles and flat triangular plate elements.4 The accuracy of these models depends on the continuous updating of the structural tangent stiffness matrix at each load increment. The tangent matrix is continuously assembled as the summation of the linear elastic stiffness matrix and the stress-dependent geometrical stiffness matrix.4 Following each iteration, the solver computes pure elastic rotations and updates the internal force vectors, capturing the localized softening of the skin as it buckles and geometrically pulls out of plane.4 Further advancements in multiscale modeling, such as the General Method of Cells (GMC), attempt to bridge the gap between microscopic fiber-matrix stress states and the macroscopic structural deformations observed in the finite element shell meshes.3

However, the immense computational cost required to invert these massive tangent stiffness matrices at hundreds of sub-increments makes finite element analysis wholly unsuited for the rapid design iterations necessary during preliminary sizing and optimization.1 A single non-linear collapse simulation can take hours to converge, whereas optimization algorithms require the evaluation of tens of thousands of combinations of composite layups, stringer spacing configurations, and web geometries.7

It is within this computational chasm that the TEW method proves its immense value. The TEW code, executable in a matter of seconds within a Python or MATLAB environment, completely bypasses the necessity for massive matrix inversions.1 By distilling the complex non-linear geometry into dynamic updates of the extensional, coupling, and bending stiffness matrices, the algorithm provides a highly physical, deterministic assessment of collapse capacity.1 An explicit observation across all five validation cases is that the predictions obtained by the TEW method do not provide definite upper or lower bounds relative to the complex finite element calculations.1 Just like the FE models, the TEW method's accuracy fluctuates based on the structural configuration. Yet, the predictable nature of its error distribution—conservatively underpredicting light, flexible structures and predictably overpredicting heavy, rigid structures—allows structural design engineers to apply targeted safety factors during the algorithmic optimization loop.1

This ensures that the computationally cheap effective width method can drive the architecture toward an optimal global minimum weight. Once the genetic algorithm or gradient-based solver converges on an optimal structural layout utilizing the TEW formulations, only that final, highly refined candidate design is submitted for expensive, rigorous validation within the non-linear ABAQUS or ANSYS environment. This hybrid computational workflow is what ultimately enables the rapid, safe design of next-generation composite aerospace structures.

## **Synthesis of Findings**

The comprehensive analysis and programmatic reproduction of the extended effective width method for laminated composite stringer-stiffened curved panels yields profound conclusions regarding the contemporary state of aerospace structural analysis.

The adaptation of classical effective width theories—historically constrained to simple, flat, isotropic plates—has been successfully executed to accommodate the complex anisotropy, coupling effects, and inherent curvature of advanced composite laminates. By rigorously reformulating the flexural, torsional, and warping rigidities of an equivalent structural column through layered matrix integrations, the underlying physics governing postbuckling load transfer are effectively captured.

The predictive fidelity of the analytical model is intrinsically linked to the global-to-local stiffness ratio of the specific panel configuration. The methodology demonstrates a clear tendency to overpredict the ultimate collapse capacity of heavily stiffened panels, primarily because the homogenized equations cannot resolve localized interfacial shear failures or premature flange delaminations that manifest physically before global Euler buckling occurs. Conversely, the algorithm conservatively underpredicts the capacity of lightly stiffened, highly flexible configurations.

Furthermore, the integration of asymmetric structural elements, specifically J-form stringers, introduces highly complex combined bending-torsion buckling modes. This physical asymmetry generates significant pre-buckling out-of-plane eccentricities that drastically amplify the structure's sensitivity to manufacturing imperfections, leading to massive experimental scatter in the initiation of first skin buckling. The analytical formulation's strict requirement to calculate and incorporate the warping rigidity and the shear center eccentricity is vital; failing to account for these parameters would result in catastrophic overestimations of panel stability.

Ultimately, the computational framework and Python implementation presented herein demonstrate that semi-analytical, iterative engineering methodologies are not historical artifacts superseded by finite element analysis. Rather, they serve as indispensable, highly efficient computational engines that enable the massive parameter sweeps required for modern composite structural optimization.
