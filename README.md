# Buckling Global Stringer

This repository contains a Python script that reproduces the results of the Technion Effective Width (TEW) method for composite curved panels, as described in the paper by Pevzner, Abramovich, and Weller (Composite Structures 83 (2008) 341-353).

The script initializes with a dictionary mapping of experimental, finite element, and analytical results. It then defines an object-oriented architecture to simulate the iterative physics of the modified effective width approach.

## Documentation

The documentation for this project is automatically generated from the Python script and is available on the [GitHub Pages site](https://saullocastro.github.io/buckling-global-stringer/).
